* Functional Connectivity and Time Weighted Undirected Graphs

* We seek to identify dynamic functional connectivity in neuronal data
** Anatomical Connectivity
   1. Structural links such as synapses or fiber pathways
   2. Difficult!
** Functional Connectivity
   1. How does information flow through the brain      
   2. Causal - extract networks of causal influences of neural elements
      - Bayesian directed graph modeling
   3. Associative - patterns of statistical dependence
      - cross correlations in an undirected setting

* Central Question we are trying to answer?
** Question:
** Who could this help? How?

* Data collection
  1. Question: Put the picture of the brain
  2. Key points here about placement of arrays and sensors
  3. Subjects are epilepsy patients preparing for surgery
  4. Recordings are used clinically to choose areas for resection
  5. Electrode locations mostly driven by clinical rather than research goals

* Recordings uses Electrocorticography (ECoG)
** Benefits
   2. ECoG is less common than EEG, fMRI or MEG
   3. Felxibility in placement - good spatial resolution
   4. Good signal to noise properties 
   5. Virtually no missingness in the signal!
** Limitations
   1. Not whole brain signal e.g. fMRI

Question: How is EcoG different from EEG?

* Our data consists of visual experiments on epilepsy patients
   1. Data collected for 20 epilepsy patients
   2. Task: Subjects are shown a series of images
   3. Faces, Bodies, Words, Hammers, Houses, Non-Objects
      1. 480 trials
      2. record 500ms pre-stimulus, 1s post-stimulus
   4. Images were chosen to represent certain concepts
      1. Faces are biological, Hammers arenâ€™t
   5. Want to understand difference in neural response based on stimulus

* Key attributes of the signal
  1. Question: What causes the signal flip? Ask MG
  2. High trial-to-trial variability
  3. 

* What have we done with the data?
** A series of transformations
   1. Covariance across channel

* Modeling with Undirected Graphs

* Key modeling enhancements we would want to employ

* Limitations of such a Model
